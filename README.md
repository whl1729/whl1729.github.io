# Live Poets Society

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
> to front only the essential facts of life,
> and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,
> and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

Dead Poets Society（死亡诗社）是我大一时看过的电影，也是我最喜欢的电影之一。
我化用这个电影名，将自己的博客命名为 Live Poets Society（生活诗社）——愿岁月如歌、生活如诗。
